# Fantalegamento

 Fantalegamento was a browser game based on the Italian version of fantasy football (fantacalcio), where players could sign up and register their teams including a selection of footballers from real teams. Results of the fantasy league would then be generated based on footballers performance at each round of the Italian championship.

 I implemented the first version of the website in 2008 and used it until 2021 to manage a league ranging across the years between approximately 10 to 30 active users.
 
 The website was implemented using a mix of HTML and PHP supported by MySQL DB. It was never designed for distribution but for personal use only, as I was personally handling the league.
 
## Usage

This version of the website is not playable as originally intended, it is only an example of the website dated prior the last championship round it was used in.
 
The code is largely outdated by modern standards and required manual access to player statistics made available by 3rd party without any sort of API.
 
DB folder contains a copy of the example database that should be imported in a MySQL instance for the site to work.

The example website can then be accessed using test users "user1" to "user12" and password "password".
